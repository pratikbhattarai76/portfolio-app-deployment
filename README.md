# 🚀 Pratik's DevOps Portfolio & Cloud Portal

A high-performance, Server-Side Rendered (SSR) portfolio built to act as the public ingress point for my self-hosted Hybrid Private Cloud. 

This repository contains the application source code, API logic for the SMTP contact module, and the automated containerization blueprints (`Dockerfile`).

🔗 **Live Deployment:** [pratik-labs.xyz](https://web.pratik-labs.xyz)

## 🏗️ DevOps & Architectural Highlights

While this functions as a portfolio, it was engineered as a **Proof of Concept** for cloud-native deployment practices:

*   **Multi-Stage Docker Build:** Utilizes a 3-stage `Dockerfile` to drastically reduce image size and attack surface. It compiles the TypeScript/Astro assets using `node:22-bookworm-slim` and ships only the compiled production artifacts in the final runner stage.
*   **Runtime Secret Injection:** Strict separation of build-time and run-time environments. SMTP credentials and API keys are not baked into the image; they are passed securely via `.env` files and `docker-compose` at runtime.
*   **Node.js SSR Adapter:** Configured to run as a dynamic Node server rather than a static site, enabling real-time REST API endpoints (like the contact form webhook) while maintaining edge-level caching.
